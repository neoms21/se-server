# Matches

## Select team
For a fixture, the manager will pick a team. The manager will be shown a list of players. In the list of players, each player will have a recent history of whether they played, rested or were unavailable.

## Edit Result
After a match has been played, the manager fills in the result. The type of entry is dependent upon the sport. Substitutions can also be entered, depending on the sport. The result, and other details, can be edited until the result is published.

## Publish Result
When the result is finalised, the result can then be published. It can be published to the league via the league's api settings, or by email. The result will also be emailed out to the other members of the club.
